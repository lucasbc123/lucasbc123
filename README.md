My name is Lucas Benazzi Cestari, I was born in 1995 and currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I graduated in Electrical Engineering from university in 2019, but always had some interest in programming.

For my Final Paper, I worked on a project called "Electric Load Forecasting on a Subsystem of Brazil". After that, all of my interest basically moved to programing.

I currently work at UrbanArts, a art selling company, where each day more then 400 new products are made available on our website and stores across the country.

I'm currently looking for a new job in order to get new experiences. I found out I can't publish most of my code work from the company, so I'm slowly building my portfolio from scratch here.

I'm a fast leaner and love the process of learning new things
