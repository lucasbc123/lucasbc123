My name is Lucas Benazzi Cestari, I was born in 1995 and currently live in São Paulo, Brazil.

I graduated in Electrical Engineering at the Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia in 2019. During the course fell in love with programing and especially Machine Learning. Been working as a backend developer for 3 years now. Looking to expand my horizons as a Data Scientist.
